To run the program follow the below steps

1. Open svd_power.m file in matlab 

2. Then in Matlab command window type following
	svd_power(<input_file_name>,<M>,<iterations>)

	Ex: svd_power('input1.txt',2,10)

	Note:  First Argument (String): input_file_name shoule be quoted and passed 
	          Second Argument (Integer): Number of Dimension as M
                          Third Argument (Integer): Number of Iteration for Power Method
	         
	         
3. All the input files has to be in same folder as the program file (*.m) resides, if not then provide the absolute path for input file.

4. After this output will be shown as mentioned in the assignment answer.
